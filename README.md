# Graph-theory
This notebook presents the approach for a data science project utilizing Graph Theory. These tasks are part of the course titled "Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications." from MIT. The notebook includes an analysis performed on two distinct datasets:
1. Criminal Data from CAVIAR Investigation: This dataset contains information spanning two years, from 1994 to 1996.
2. Email-EU Network Dataset: This dataset focuses on the analysis of email interactions within a European network.


## âœ… Analysis
It shows analysis related with
1. General graph analysis
2. Centrality measures
3. Clustering algorithms for graphs
4. Hypothesis testing
